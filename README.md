# Queueing-Model
This Github project describes a system that consists of a single CPU with finite buffer capacity. Jobs arrive following a Poisson process with rate 𝜆 jobs/sec, and their sizes are exponentially distributed with mean 1/𝜇 seconds. The system services jobs in FCFS order, and N - 1 represents the maximum number of jobs that the system can hold in the queue, including the job serving. There are a maximum of N jobs in the system at any one time. If a job arrives when there are already N jobs in the system, then the arriving job is rejected.
