# Queueing-Model
This Github project outlines a system with a single CPU and finite buffer capacity. Jobs arrive through a Poisson process with rate 𝜆 jobs/sec and exponentially distributed sizes with mean 1/𝜇 seconds. Jobs are serviced in FCFS order, with a maximum of N-1 jobs allowed in the queue, including the job being serviced.
